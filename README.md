# Credit card defaulter
## Description:
Identifying customers for a bank whether they would default credit-card payments of the bank. This is a binary calssification task performed using tree based model (Decision tree) and ensemble technique (Random Forest). The classification is done based on other independent features such as account type, loan taken, duration, marital status etc. Using the random forest calsssifier's feature importance function, Account duration, age and account month are found out to have most co-relation with the target variable and are the most important features. This project is also an practicle example of how an ensemeble technique overcomes the issue of overfitting that happenes in tree based models.

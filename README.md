# Credit Card Defaulter Prediction using Decision Tree and Random Forest
## Business Understanding:
This project aims to identify customers who are likely to default on credit card payments using a binary classification task. The classification is performed using a decision tree and an ensemble technique (Random Forest), based on independent features such as account type, loan taken, duration, and marital status.

## Results:
The project utilizes the feature importance function of the Random Forest classifier to identify the most important features that have the most correlation with the target variable. The features identified as the most important are account duration, age, and account month.
The ensemble technique of Random Forest helps overcome the issue of overfitting by combining multiple decision trees and reducing the variance of the model.
The outcome of the project is a reliable and accurate model that can be used to predict credit card payment defaults, helping the bank to manage credit risk and improve financial performance.

## Technologies Used:

### Machine Learning Models:
1. Decision tree classifier
2. Random Forest classifier
   
### Programming Language:
1. Python

## Approach:
1. Collect and preprocess data related to customer accounts and credit card payments.
2. Train and evaluate the decision tree and Random Forest models.
3. Analyze the feature importance results to identify the most relevant features.
4. Build a reliable and accurate model for predicting credit card payment defaults.
